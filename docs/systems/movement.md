# Movement System

Customizations around character locomotion.

## Component
- `PFCharacterMovementComponent`: modifies base speeds & sprint logic.

## Sprint
| Parameter | Placeholder | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Base Walk Speed | TBD | Default movement |
| Sprint Multiplier | TBD | Applied during GA_Sprint |
| Stamina Drain Rate | TBD | Tied to periodic stamina cost effect |

## Tackle Impact (Planned)
- Stop movement using `GE_ApplyTackled`.
- Possibly root motion animation integration.
