# Project Football

> Lightweight technical & content documentation for the Unreal Engine 5.6 prototype.

## Purpose
Capture just enough shared knowledge to move fast without re‑explaining core systems.

## Start Here
- Quick setup: see [Quick Start](quick-start.md)
- Folder + naming: see [Project Structure](project-structure.md)
- Ability framework: see [Ability System](gameplay/ability-system.md)

## Core Systems (Snapshot)
| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Ability System | Early | Sprint / Throw / Tackle / Block implemented |
| Movement | Early | Custom movement component present |
| Input | Early | Enhanced Input contexts wired |
| UI HUD | Prototype | `WBP_QBHUD` placeholder |

## Maps
Current: Prototype field, third-person test, lobby staging.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Tuning stamina + cost effects
2. Add catch / possession logic
3. Basic scoreboard UI
